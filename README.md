El primer joc!

This is my first try of making a game with the GDXlib. Learning from zero every part of a game. I want to make every single part of the game, like sounds, 
music, images and everything.
I'm on first year of programming studies in el Puig, my school. This is only a learning project.

Be free to use my images or sounds in your projects, I will be happy to know and see my images in other games remember to show me! By the moment not all 
sounds and music are mine. Some sounds are from https://bigsoundbank.com for free use too. And music from https://www.purple-planet.com/ .

Salut!
